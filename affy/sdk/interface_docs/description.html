<h1><a class="anchor" name="description">Writing expression results to a &quot;quantification&quot; CHP file.</a></h1>This program is provided as an example of using the Fusion SDK to write expression results to an Affymetrix "quantification" CHP file. The quantification CHP file was designed to store a set of quantification values with their associated probe set names. The Expression Console software currently uses the "quantification" CHP file for storing results from the RMA and PLIER algorithms.<p>
The program is implemented as a command line application. The arguments specify items such as the TSV file containing the expression results, algorithm parameters, summary statistics, probe array type, parent CEL file, and other items that are stored in the CHP file header.<p>
This program is provided as an example of using the Fusion SDK to write genotype results to an Affymetrix "multi-data" CHP file. The multi-data CHP file was designed to store a variety of Affymetrix results, including genotypes and copy number. The Genotyping Console software currently uses the "multi-data" CHP file for storing genotype results from the BRLMM-P and Birdseed algorithms as well as copy number results from its copy number algorithms.<p>
The program is implemented as a command line application. The arguments specify items such as the TSV file containing the genotype results, algorithm parameters, summary statistics, probe array type, parent CEL file, and other items that are stored in the CHP file header. <hr size="1"><address style="text-align: right;"><small>Generated on Wed Nov 14 09:01:34 2007 for Affymetrix Fusion SDK by&nbsp;
