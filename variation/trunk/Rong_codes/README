Rong Jiang's code. it's his package for oligo (Carvalho2007) genotype calling. 
from /Network/Data/250k/tmp-jr/basecall/oligo-basecall-jr.tar
parameters estimated from 31 perlegen overlapping arrays.
normalization data of 107 out of initial 163 arrays.
other associated R/shell/c-binary programs


2008-07-01 The stucture of all programs here is:

- new_basecall.R

  program to do oligo calls. running it without arguments will output help. it loads some other R scripts
  and R data file in the same directory.

- wrap_basecall.sh and new_basecall.sh are deprecated because new_basecall.R can now handle arguments.

- process-calls:

  program to refine the output of new_basecall.R to be in format compliant of db stock_250k's requirement.
  it takes file with fixed name 'calls.txt' in the current directory as implicit input.
  function transform_oligo_prob_out2std_call_format() in variation/src/impute.py can do this same job in a much nicer way.

  ./process-calls $array_id $min_oligo_prob


- plot-mean-intensity-348arrays.R:

  program to plot mean intensity histogram of any arrays. running it without arguments will output help.
